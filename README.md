**Sinhala spelling corrector**
Two methods were used to implement the Sinhala spelling corrector. LSTM model model performs well with 95.46% accuracy.

Here we used more than 100000 words labeled dataset to do this. Now You can See how sample inputs perform in LSTM model.

Then We tried to make a simple GUI using the GRADIO python package. You have to install the Gradio package before using this.
